# COURSE DESCRIPTION:

The Linux operating system is everywhere, over 95% of web servers run on the Linux operating system. So even if you have not used Linux firsthand you still have interacted with it before. Welcome to the world of Linux! 

This course brings students from the absolute basics of the Linux command-line interface (CLI) to having working knowledge they can use in future coursework and career. Using hands-on in-class exercise and labs students will learn to navigate the file system, perform essential file operations, and use common Linux programs. Furthermore, this course covers fundamental concepts including text editing, file permissions, and basic software management. By the end of the term, students will go from knowing nothing about Linux to being able to perform simple common system tasks and create basic shell scripts, providing a foundation for future courses such as CS100 and CS183 and their careers.


# KEY LEARNING OUTCOMES:

By the end of this class students will be able to:

+ Demonstrate their understanding of the Linux file system by executing commands using the command-line interface (CLI) to perform basic file and directory operations (create, copy, move, delete, symbolic links, etc.) 
+ Execute shell commands to manage file permissions and ownership.
+ Utilize common Linux commands for system information, process management, text stream manipulation. As well as basic system administration tasks such as updating packages and installing new programs..
+ Modify text files using command-line editors nano and vim
+ Design and construct BASH scripts including using pipes, redirection for command chaining, I/O  manipulation.

# ASSESSMENT:

Students will be assessed with in-class exercises, labs, and quizzes.

In-Class Exercises are assignments given and completed with the regular class time used to explore a high-level overview of the lecture topic with a hands-on activity. Students will use Github Codespaces to complete these assignments. These will be graded on effort and take roughly 20 minutes. Students will submit them on gradescope.

Lab assignments are more in-depth assignments that have students apply the knowledge from the lecture to complete more complex tasks akin to real world use cases. Each lab will be different from assignment to assignment but will require students to utilize various common Linux operations. These will be submitted through gradescope and will be graded based on correctness.

Quizzes will be given weekly online through Canvas/Gradescope and are used to assess students' comprehension of the week's lecture material. For example, a quiz may show an example of usages of a Linux command and its output to have students identify errors or fill in the blank for specific command line arguments. These will be graded on correctness and will have 5-10 multiple choice and/or fill in the blank questions.

# EVALUATION OF STUDENT PERFORMANCE

| Activity | Percentage possible  |
| :---- | :---- |
| In-Class Exercises (9 Total) | 9% (1% each) |
| Quizzes (9 Total) | 21% (2.34% each) |
| Labs (7 Total) | 70% (10% each) |



# METHODS OF INSTRUCTION:

To verify that students can meet the objectives of this course, each lecture will include a hands-on activity where students will identify how to utilize lecture material to complete common tasks with the Linux operating system.

For Labs and In-Class Exercises we will use GitHub Codespaces. Codespace’s allow students on any platform to have a consistent development environment. You can even use it on your phone! Codespaces are free for roughly 60 hours of active use which is more than enough for this course. The only thing you need is a free github account. Students will be able to access Codespaces from anywhere with an internet connection.

# ACADEMIC ACCOMMODATIONS

Students are encouraged to take an active role as their own advocates. They are not required to identify themselves as having a disability; however, students are not eligible for accommodations unless they self-identify. Students are responsible for visiting the SDRC office (Student Disability Resource Center, 125 Costo Hall (951) 827-4538, http://sdrc.ucr.edu/, and obtaining and delivering letters detailing appropriate accommodations to each of their instructors in a timely manner every quarter. 




Instructors are responsible for assisting in providing accommodations; students are required to make requests in an appropriate and timely manner. Ordinarily, required accommodations are described in a letter, which is given to the instructor by the student. Classroom accommodations may involve providing space for a sign language interpreter or real-time captionist, asking students to clear a path for wheelchair users, announcing need for note takers, for example. Some accommodations, such as materials in Braille, large print, or electronic format, readers, and special equipment for testing or composing papers, are provided outside of the classroom by SDRC.




# ACADEMIC RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES

“All students, faculty, and staff are responsible for understanding and complying with the University’s stated academic requirements.  Students should feel free to express their thoughts and opinions in an academic forum.  Assignments must be completed by the student for whom the work is assigned and without unauthorized aid of any kind.”




# ACADEMIC INTEGRITY

At UCR we are committed to upholding and promoting the values of the Tartan Soul: Integrity, Accountability, Excellence, and Respect. As a student in this class, it is your responsibility to act in accordance with these values by completing all assignments in the manner described, and by informing the instructor of suspected acts of academic misconduct by your peers. By doing so, you will not only affirm your own integrity, but also the integrity of the intellectual work of this University, and the degree which it represents. Should you choose to commit academic misconduct in this class, you will be held accountable according to the policies set forth by the University, and will incur appropriate consequences both in this class and from Student Conduct and Academic Integrity Programs. For more information regarding University policy and its enforcement, please visit: conduct.ucr.edu. 




Labs and Quizzes must be completed on your own with no collaboration with your other classmates. You may reference any course material as well as use the internet. The use of generative AI such as ChatGPT, Google Gemini, Calude, etc is not allowed. With in-class activities I encourage you to talk to your peers and solve the problems together.




Thank you for participating in the class!  




# TECHNOLOGY POLICY
